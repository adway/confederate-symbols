# Comparing and Visualizing Confederate Symbols in the United States

## Introduction
In recent years, white supremicists have come out in the open with their beliefs. With the rally in Charlottesville, last year, and the upcoming rally on Aug. 11 and 12, it is becoming more prevalent now than ever to understand our history.

## Goals
* Visualize confederate symbols based on state.
* Visualize confederate symbols based on type of symbol.
* Visualize the location of these symbols, on the US map, using latitude and longitude.

## Future Goals
* Compute confederate symbols per square mile
* Compute confederate symbols per 100k people.
